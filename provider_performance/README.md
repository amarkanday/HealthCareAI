## Methodology Deep Dive

### 1. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)

**Purpose**: Measure relative efficiency of healthcare providers compared to best-practice frontier

**Implementation**:
- Input variables: Operating costs, staffing hours, resource allocation
- Output variables: Patient volume, satisfaction scores, clinical outcomes
- Efficiency scores: 0.0 (least efficient) to 1.0 (most efficient)

**Key Insights**:
- Identification of efficient providers serving as benchmarks
- Quantification of improvement opportunities
- Resource optimization recommendations

### 2. Quality Score Modeling

**Components**:
- **Clinical Outcomes (40%)**: Mortality, readmission, complication rates
- **Patient Safety (30%)**: Infection control, medication errors, adverse events
- **Patient Experience (30%)**: Satisfaction, communication, care coordination

**Calculation**:
```python
quality_score = (clinical_score * 0.4 + 
                safety_score * 0.3 + 
                experience_score * 0.3) * 100
```

### 3. Performance Driver Analysis

**Correlation Analysis**: Identification of factors most strongly associated with quality performance

**Key Variables Analyzed**:
- Structural characteristics (size, teaching status, ownership)
- Financial metrics (costs, investments, efficiency ratios)
- Staffing patterns (nurse-to-patient ratios, physician coverage)
- Market factors (competition, demographics, geography)

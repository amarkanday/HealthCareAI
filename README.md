## Case Studies

### 🏥 [Hospital Readmission Prevention](readmissions/)
Learn how machine learning models can predict and prevent hospital readmissions, achieving 91% accuracy in identifying high-risk patients and enabling targeted interventions that reduce readmissions by 25-40%.

### 💰 [Healthcare Cost Prediction](healthcare_costs/)
Explore how health insurance companies use deep learning models (RNNs/LSTMs) to predict future healthcare costs, enabling personalized premiums, risk management, and proactive care interventions.

### 📊 [Health Insurance Member Risk Scoring](risk_scoring/)
Discover how insurance companies use machine learning to predict high-cost healthcare utilization among members, achieving 86% accuracy with gradient boosting models for effective care management and cost optimization.

### 🤖 [Large Language Models and RAG in Healthcare](llm_and_rag/)
Comprehensive examination of how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are transforming healthcare delivery, enabling clinical decision support, automated documentation, medical knowledge retrieval, and personalized patient care.

### 📈 [Healthcare Provider Performance Models](provider_performance/)

### Basic Usage

```python
from healthcare_llm_rag_implementation import (
    ClinicalDocumentationSystem,
    ClinicalDecisionSupport,
    DrugInteractionAnalyzer,
    PatientEducationSystem,
    MedicalCodingSystem
)

# Initialize systems
doc_system = ClinicalDocumentationSystem()
decision_support = ClinicalDecisionSupport()
drug_analyzer = DrugInteractionAnalyzer()
education_system = PatientEducationSystem()
coding_system = MedicalCodingSystem()

# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'age': 65,
    'gender': 'female',
    'conditions': ['diabetes', 'hypertension'],
    'medications': ['metformin', 'lisinopril'],
    'education_level': 'high',
    'preferred_language': 'english'
}

# Clinical documentation summarization
clinical_notes = """
Patient presents for follow-up of diabetes and hypertension. 
Blood pressure 145/90, blood glucose 180. 
Patient reports taking metformin and lisinopril as prescribed.
Physical exam unremarkable. Continue current medications.
"""

summary = doc_system.summarize_clinical_notes(clinical_notes, patient_data)
print(summary)
```

### Clinical Decision Support

```python
# Generate treatment recommendations
recommendations = decision_support.generate_treatment_recommendations(
    patient_data, 
    "How should I manage this patient's diabetes?"
)
print(recommendations)
```

### Drug Interaction Analysis

```python
# Analyze medication interactions
interactions = drug_analyzer.analyze_drug_interactions(
    patient_data['medications'], 
    patient_data
)
print(interactions)
```

### Patient Education

```python
# Generate personalized education materials
education = education_system.generate_patient_education('diabetes', patient_data)
print(education)
```

### Medical Coding

```python
# Generate medical codes for billing
coding = coding_system.generate_medical_codes(clinical_notes, patient_data)
print(coding)
```

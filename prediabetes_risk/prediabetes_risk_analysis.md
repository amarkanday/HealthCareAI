## 1. Problem Statement

### The Prediabetes Challenge

Prediabetes affects **96 million adults** in the United States (1 in 3 adults), yet **80% are unaware** they have the condition. Without intervention, 15-30% of people with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years.

**Clinical Challenge**:
- Asymptomatic condition requiring active screening
- Resource constraints limiting universal screening
- Need for risk stratification to optimize interventions
- Population health management at scale

**Economic Impact**:
- Annual diabetes care costs: $13,700 per patient
- Prediabetes intervention programs: $1,500 per patient
- ROI of prevention: 3:1 to 7:1 over 10 years

### Traditional Screening Limitations

**Current Approaches**:
- Age-based screening (≥45 years)
- BMI-based screening (≥25 kg/m²)
- Family history assessment
- Clinical risk factor evaluation

**Limitations**:
- Low sensitivity for younger adults
- Missing at-risk individuals with normal BMI
- Suboptimal resource allocation
- Limited personalization
